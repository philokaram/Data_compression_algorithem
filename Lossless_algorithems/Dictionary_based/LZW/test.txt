Data compression has been an enabling technology for the information revolution, and as this
revolution has changed our lives, data compression has become a more and more ubiquitous, if
often invisible, presence. From mp3 players, to smartphones, to digital television and movies,
data compression is an integral part of almost all information technology. This incorporation of
compression into more and more of our lives also points to a certain degree of maturation and
stability of the technology. This maturity is reflected in the fact that there are fewer differences
between each edition of this book. In the second edition we added new techniques that had been
developed since the first edition of this book came out. In the third edition we added a chapter
on audio compression, a topic that had not been adequately covered in the second edition. In
this edition we have tried to do the same with wavelet-based compression, in particular with the

increasingly popular JPEG 2000 standard. There are now two chapters dealing with wavelet-
based compression, one devoted exclusively to wavelet-based image compression algorithms.

We have also filled in details that were left out from previous editions, such as a description
of canonical Huffman codes and more information on binary arithmetic coding. We have also
added descriptions of techniques that have been motivated by the Internet, such as the speech
coding algorithms used for Internet applications.
All this has yet again enlarged the book. However, the intent remains the same: to provide
an introduction to the art or science of data compression. There is a tutorial description of most
of the popular compression techniques followed by a description of how these techniques are
used for image, speech, text, audio, and video compression. One hopes the size of the book
will not be intimidating. Once you open the book and begin reading a particular section we
hope you will find the content easily accessible. If some material is not clear write to me at
sayood@datacompression.unl.edu with specific questions and I will try and help (homework
problems and projects are completely your responsibility).
